# CircuitVerse Runbooks


## Suggested Runbook Structure

Runbooks should be the main source of truth for maintaining a service. This
means we need to document all necessary information about a service here. On the
other hand, runbooks should be a concise list of actions without distracting
with too many information. Therefore, the following structure for each service
directory is suggested - in accordance with the structure suggested by the
[service readiness review
template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/service_readiness.md).

```
  docs/
    <service-name>/
      README.md         # partly autogenerated and structured as defined below
      <runbook-1>.md
      <runbook-2>.md
```
