# CircuitVerse Runbooks

Runbooks should be the main source of truth for maintaining a service. This
means we need to document all necessary information about a service here.

General principles:
- as concise as possible, covering all important information
- avoid duplication

#### Suggested Runbook Structure
```bash
  docs/
    <service-name>/
      README.md         
      <runbook-1>.md
      <runbook-2>.md
```
