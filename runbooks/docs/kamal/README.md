# Kamal

[CircuitVerse](github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse) uses docker containers for production deployment which are orchestrated 
using [kamal](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal). 

Kamal uses the dynamic reverse-proxy Traefik to hold requests, while the new app container is started and the old one is 
stopped â€” working seamlessly across multiple hosts, using SSHKit to execute commands.


## Configuration 

Kamal Configuration

- [config/deploy.yml](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/blob/master/config/deploy.yml)

Running data migrations

This will spin up a new container and then run `bin/rails data:migrate` inside it.
